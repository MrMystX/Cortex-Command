	Description = A large network of caves deep underground. Presumably created by a long-extinct species of tunneling animal, these caves now lie uninhabited due to the area's sparse vegetation and dryness. Named in honor of Kramoris Dvorak, a researcher whose study of the planet's native crablike fauna led to more effective methods of control.

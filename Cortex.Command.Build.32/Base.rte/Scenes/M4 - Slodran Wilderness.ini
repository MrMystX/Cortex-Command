	PresetName = M4 - Slodran Wilderness
	Description = Snow covered rough terrain with a large dormant volcano. Preliminary research suggests that the majestic glaciers covering the area have thinned considerably in the last fifty millennia. Most of the planet's fresh water comes from underground streams originating in the environing area.

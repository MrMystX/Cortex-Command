	PresetName = M2 - Burraki Desert
	Description = Dry and empty on the surface, but contains great valuable resources underground. This area is known for alternating between periods of intense and calm weather. For the last six months, hurricane-force sandstorms have prevented any form of colonization, but the gales have begun to die down. The current state of calm is expected to last between one and two Earth years, making this an ideal time to search for gold which may have been exposed somewhat by the harsh winds.

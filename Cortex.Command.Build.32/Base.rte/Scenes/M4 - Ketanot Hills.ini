	PresetName = M4 - Ketanot Hills
	Description = Large, steep hills with a characteristically stony cave in the center. There has been debate regarding whether or not the flat formations within the cave are natural. Theories range from cave-dwelling, pre-crab organisms to full-fledged ancient civilizations. However, due to the abundance of gold in the environing area, research into the cave has been impeded by ongoing firefights.

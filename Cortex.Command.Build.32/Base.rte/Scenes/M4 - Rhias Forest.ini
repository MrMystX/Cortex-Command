	Description = A forest clearing with a handful of caves. You can find plenty of gold here, but you'll have to dig in deep. Kardan Rhias, a scientist working for the International Space Commission, was the first human to make contact with aliens. Despite being reprimanded and subsequently fired for doing so, Rhias personally met with a S'vaari ambassador and formed diplomatic ties with the alien race on behalf of Earth. Years later, after intergalactic trade led to a flourishing economy, Rhias was posthumously forgiven, and is now seen by most humans as a heroic figure.

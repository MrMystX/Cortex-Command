	PresetName = M4 - Yskely Mountains
	Description = Lots of vertical elevation and rough terrain. You will find many caves within the mountains and big pockets of gold deep in the terrain. The area is named for the first satellite probe to orbit the planet, Yskely, which was struck by a stray piece of construction material from the yet-unbuilt Tradestar Midas. It mostly burned up in the planet's atmosphere, but its data core, which was specifically designed to survive re-entry, was retrieved high in the Yskely Mountains.

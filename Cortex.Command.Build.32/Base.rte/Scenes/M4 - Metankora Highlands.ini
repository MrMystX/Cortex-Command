	Description = Slightly mountainous region with small underground caves and high gold density. The region's name alludes to the infamous Metankora Incident, which occurred in the early days of the intergalactic gold rush. A malfunctioning targeting system onboard a human battleship provided incorrect coordinates for a long-range railgun strike, leading to the total destruction of a commercial fleet carrying millions of dollars worth of gold. The nearby low-atmosphere colony of Metankora experienced "golden rain" for several days after the incident, and its name has since been associated with unexpected wealth.
